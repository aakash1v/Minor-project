      <p>
        The Gate Pass Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of issuing gate passes for students in a university or hostel setting. The system automates the approval process for gate passes, making it more efficient and accessible.
      </p>

      <h5>Our Mission</h5>
      <p>
        Our mission is to provide an easy-to-use system that reduces the administrative burden of issuing gate passes while ensuring that all necessary checks and approvals are followed. By doing so, we aim to improve campus security and ensure the safety of students.
      </p>

      <h5>Key Features</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Student-friendly gate pass requests</li>
        <li>Easy approval workflows for HODs, Deans, and Wardens</li>
        <li>Real-time tracking of gate pass status</li>
        <li>Efficient record-keeping and reporting</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>How it Works</h5>
      <p>
        Students can request gate passes through the system, which will then be reviewed by the relevant authorities (HOD, Dean, Warden). Once all approvals are obtained, the gate pass will be issued and the student can exit the campus or hostel. The system keeps track of each request, making it easy for admins to manage and review the data.
